      "Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), including drones, have improved greatly over the past decade. Drones have proven their value in war zones, delivering medical supplies, and even in areas like transportation, surveillance, surveying, and mapping. Despite these advancements, creating a fully autonomous drone swarm with real-time sensing and decision-making abilities is still a challenge.Our project, GAGANMITRA Drones, focuses on building a swarm of three drones that are efficient, reliable, and well-coordinated. We use a star topology for communication between the Raspberry Pi computers on each drone. A central drone manages the system, ensuring all drones know each other's positions and actions, such as moving or hovering. The system includes algorithms for real-time sensing. For example, if one drone crosses a boundary, others adjust to bring it back into the safe zone.To avoid a single point of failure (SPOF), any drone can take over as the leader if the central one fails. The drones can also communicate within a 2 km range using advanced telemetry. They are powered by Pixhawk flight controllers, which manage navigation and motor control. We tested these drones in the ROS1 Noetic-Gazebo environment, successfully running formations and verifying algorithms.",

This robot was part of a competition where we were selected in the first round, and for the second round of proof of concept, we received â‚¹50,000 from ROBOFEST 4.0, organized by the Government of Gujarat, to help realize this project. The robot features six legs with 18 degrees of freedom, controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller and an 18-channel servo driver module. Powered by a 7.4V Li-Po battery (5200mAh), it incorporates ultrasonic and gyroscopic sensors alongside a camera module for precise obstacle detection, balance maintenance, and environmental awareness. The use of 3D-printed brackets ensures a lightweight yet robust structure, enhancing its adaptability for diverse terrains.",

      "The development of multi-purpose power attachments for wheelchairs represents a significant advancement in assistive technology, addressing the mobility challenges faced by individuals with physical disabilities. Traditional wheelchairs, while essential, often lack powered assistance, leading to dependence on caregivers and limiting user autonomy. This literature review explores the current landscape of electric power attachments, their design considerations, and the impact of such innovations on user independence and quality of life. Recent advancements in wheelchair technology have introduced models equipped with sophisticated features, including joystick controls, modern designs, and application integration. However, these high-tech wheelchairs often come with prohibitive costs and require considerable space, making them inaccessible to many users. While NGOs and government subsidies provide basic wheelchairs, these models typically lack powered assistance, further emphasizing the need for affordable and flexible solutions. The introduction of electric power attachments, such as battery-powered motor wheels combined with hand-controlled systems, aims to bridge the gap between traditional wheelchairs and advanced mobility solutions. These attachments offer several advantages:1. Affordability 2. Flexibility 3. Independence 4. Usability 5. Safety 6. Integration with Existing Wheelchairs",

Tugger and trolley systems utilize a combination of sensors, algorithms, and software to ensure that they move smoothly and safely through the warehouse environment. These systems are capable of navigating around obstacles and avoiding collisions with other equipment and personnel, which makes them a safer alternative to traditional manual material handling methods. Tugger and trolley systems are also highly flexible and customizable, which makes them suitable for a wide range of warehouse environments and applications. These systems can be configured to handle different types of products and materials, and they can be integrated with other warehouse automation systems, such as conveyor belts and robotic picking systems in the future.",

      "The AI-Enabled Smart Bin is an innovative solution designed to revolutionize waste management by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and audio classification technologies. This smart bin employs AI to analyze the sounds generated by discarded items, enabling accurate identification and sorting of various waste types. By improving recycling efficiency and reducing contamination, the system promotes sustainable waste management practices. The smart bin functions by leveraging machine learning to classify waste based on the sound of its collision, sorting it into separate internal compartments. Development begins with clearly defining the problem and collecting audio samples from different types of waste. These audio samples are pre-processed to clean and segment the data for better analysis. Machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are trained on the extracted audio features to achieve accurate classification. Once trained, the system's performance is rigorously evaluated. The project integrates key hardware componentsâ€”microphones, a processing unit, and a sorting mechanismâ€”with real-time software for waste classification and sorting. After deployment, the system's performance is monitored and refined to enhance efficiency. This project demonstrates the effective use of technologies like audio processing, machine learning, embedded systems, and software development to support sustainable recycling and waste management.",
